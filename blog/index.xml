      <description>The visual world is a useful paradigm in psycholinguistics for tracking peopleâ€™s eye fixations as they listen to sentences containing some kind of experimental manipulation.

To answer this, we need to decide when in each condition people start looking at the target and compare these timepoints between conditions.</description>
