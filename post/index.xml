      <description>The visual world is a useful paradigm in psycholinguistics for tracking peopleâ€™s eye fixations as they listen to sentences containing some kind of experimental manipulation. A common question is whether the experimental manipulation makes people fixate on a target object earlier in one condition versus another. To answer this, we need to decide when in each condition people start looking at the target more than other objects and then compare these timepoints between conditions.</description>
