      <description>The visual world is a useful paradigm in psycholinguistics for tracking people’s eye fixations as they listen to sentences containing some kind of experimental manipulation. A common question is whether the experimental manipulation makes people fixate on a target object earlier in one condition versus another. To answer this, we need to decide when in each condition people start looking at the target more than at other objects and then compare these timepoints between conditions.</description>

      <description>I am a psycholinguist in the Cognitive Neuroscience Lab and the Vasishth Lab at the University of Potsdam, Germany. My interest is in probabilistic sentence processing and what this tells us about how words are stored and accessed in the brain. More generally, I am interested in how different fields such as neuroscience, computer science and linguistics can inform each other to build comprehensive theories of human cognition.
